## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to download the HTML file and the three JavaScript files (challenge1.js, challenge2.js, and challenge3.js). Ensure that these files are in the same directory.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser.
2. You will see three buttons, each corresponding to one of the challenges.
3. Click on a button to execute the corresponding challenge's function.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade, as follows:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C - 59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok." Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended."

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program that calculates an individual's Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary based on the provided tax rates, NHIF rates, and NSSF rates.
